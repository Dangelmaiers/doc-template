# Maintenance Documentation

This document outlines the standard structure and best practices for creating maintenance documentation in the Dangelmaiers organization repositories.

## Maintenance Documentation Structure

All maintenance documentation should be organized in the `maintenance/` directory following this structure:

```
maintenance/
├── README.md                   # This file
├── procedures/                 # Standard maintenance procedures
│   ├── backup.md               # Backup procedures
│   ├── updates.md              # Update procedures
│   └── monitoring.md           # Monitoring procedures
├── schedules/                  # Maintenance schedules
│   ├── daily-tasks.md          # Daily maintenance tasks
│   ├── weekly-tasks.md         # Weekly maintenance tasks
│   └── monthly-tasks.md        # Monthly maintenance tasks
└── emergency/                  # Emergency procedures
    ├── disaster-recovery.md    # Disaster recovery procedures
    ├── incident-response.md    # Incident response procedures
    └── failover.md             # Failover procedures
```

## Standard Sections for Maintenance Documentation

Every maintenance document should include the following sections:

### 1. Purpose and Scope

Clearly define what the maintenance procedure covers and its purpose:

```markdown
## Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the procedure for performing database backups on the production environment. It covers MySQL databases used by critical services A, B, and C.
```

### 2. Prerequisites

List all requirements before beginning the maintenance procedure:

```markdown
## Prerequisites

- Database administrator access
- Minimum 20GB free disk space
- Maintenance window approved (for production systems)
- Backup storage location accessible
```

### 3. Procedure Steps

Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions:

```markdown
## Procedure

1. Verify database status:
   ```sql
   SHOW STATUS;
   ```

2. Create backup:
   ```bash
   mysqldump --all-databases > /backup/full-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

3. Verify backup integrity:
   ```bash
   mysqlcheck --check-only --all-databases
   ```
```

### 4. Verification

Include steps to verify successful completion:

```markdown
## Verification

1. Check backup file size:
   ```bash
   ls -lh /backup/full-*.sql
   ```

2. Perform test restore on staging:
   ```bash
   mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE test_restore"
   mysql test_restore < /backup/full-*.sql
   ```
